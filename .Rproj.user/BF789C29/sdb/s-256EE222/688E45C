The first section calculates the\nmean age of the faculty, along with other simple data such as the oldest and youngest members of the faculty.\nThe second section investigates how the average age varies among different departments and different\ndivisions. The third section explores how the completion of terminal degrees influenced the age of the\nfaculty.\\\\\n\n\\section{Mean Age of Faculty}\n\n\\subsection{Assembling the Data}\nThe data was collected from the Williams College Bulletin from the year 2013-14, which was found on the\nwebsite of the Registrar's Office. The data was taken from the year 2013-14 since the bulletin for the\nlatest calendar year, 2014-15, did not include the necessary information.\\\\\n\nThe information collected were the names of all professors, their departments, the year they received their\nBA, and the year they received their last degree. Any professors who did not provide all of the above\ninformation were omitted. From these data their age and the division they belong to were inferred.\nAll of the data were entered manually by the author.\nThe full data can be found in the data/ folder in the package.\\\\\n\nSeveral assumptions were made in clarifying ambiguous cases. All professors belonging to more than one\ndepartment were classified into the one mentioned first in the document. Professors belonging to departments\nwith only one or two professors who also taught courses in other departments were classified into departments\nwith more professors. This was done to make sure that each department had a sufficient number of professors\nto conduct an accurate comparison among departments. Some exceptions are the Comparative Literature department\nwith two professors, and the Marine Sciences department with one professor, both of which were kept in the analysis as the professors could not be classified into other departments. And finally, professors of French,\nSpanish, and Italian were all grouped as Romance Languages professors, since some professors were only\nindicated as such and their specific language of specialty could not be determined.\n\n\\subsection{Calculating the Mean Age}\nThe age of the professor was calculated with the assumption that all professors received their BA at the\nage of 22. Although this is clearly an underestimation, data on the average age of college students receiving\ntheir BA could not be obtained, so this was the only reasonable assumption possible. The mean age was\ncalculated as of the year 2014 in order to gain an estimate of the average age at the time; the assumption\nis that older professors retire and younger professors come in every year, keeping the average age consistent.\nHence the equation used to calculate the average age is $2014 - $gradyear$ + 22$, where gradyear refers to\nthe year the professor received his/her BA.\\\\\n\nApplying this equation to all professors, and finding the mean (and the standard deviation) of the results\nyields the estimated mean age of all professors at Williams College.\n\n<<echo = FALSE>>=\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nsetwd('../')\nsource('R/main.R')\ndata(allprofs)\nanalyse_data(allprofs)\n@\n\nThus the average age of the Williams College faculty is 49.0 years, with a standard deviation of 12 years.\n\n\\subsection{Finding the Oldest and the Youngest Professors}\n\nNow that the data is assembled, the oldest and the youngest professors can also be determined.\nThis can be done by arranging the data from the oldest to youngest, and looking at the top and the bottom\nof the table. \\\\\n\nHere is the top of the table.\\\\\n\n<<echo = FALSE>>=\nget_table()\nkable(table_top, row.names = FALSE)\n@\n\\hfill\n\\\\\nFrom this it can be seen that the oldest members of the faculty are Professor Donald de B. Beaver and Professor Charles B. Dew, both in the History Department. They received their BA in the year 1958 and thus their estimated age is 78 years.\\\\\n\nNow here is the bottom of the table.\\\\\n\n<<echo = FALSE>>=\nkable(table_bottom, row.names = FALSE)\n@\n\\hfill\n\\\\\nThe youngest member of the faculty is Professor Sarah A. Mirseydi in the Art Department, who received her BA in the year 2011 and is estimated to be 25 years old.\\\\\n\n\\section{Comparison among Departments and Divisions}\n\nIn this section ages among different departments and divisions will be analysed through graphical\nrepresentations of the data. Firstly the age histogram of all professors can be used to examine how the\nage distribution depends on the division. The division of each professor was inferred by the author,\naccording to their departments. The three divisions are I: Languages and the Arts, II: Social Studies, and\nIII: Science and Mathematics. Professors of Physical Education was classified as \"PE\", since they do not\nbelong to the three divisions.\\\\\n\nHere is the histogram showing the age distribution in different divisions.\n\n<<fig.pos=\"h\", fig.height=4, fig.cap=\"Histogram of age distribution\", echo = FALSE>>=\nget_plot1()\n@\n\nIt appears that Division II and Division III have more younger professors, while in Division I the age is\ndistributed very evenly. As expected, Physical Education professors also seem to be younger than average, with\nno professor being over 70 years of age. \\\\\n\nThe mean age of each division can be calculated.\n\n<<echo = FALSE>>=\nget_mean()\n@\n\nThis confirms that on average, PE professors are youngest, Division I professors are oldest, and Division\nII and Division III professors are somewhere in between.\\\\\n\nThe age distributions in each department can also be examined.\n\n<<fig.pos=\"h\", fig.height=4, fig.cap=\"Age distribution in each department\", echo = FALSE>>=\nget_plot2()\n@\n\nFour departments stand out for having a low mean age: Africana Studies, Arabic, Latina/o studies and\nStatistics. Two departments that are significantly older than others are Astronomy (Division III) and\nLeadership Studies (Division II). This is interesting considering Division III and Division II appeared\nto be younger than Division I. However the two departments may not have had a significant influence on the\nmean age of the division due to the relatively small sizes of the departments.\\\\\n\nIn Division I it can be seen that no department is exceptionally young or old, confirming the finding from\nabove that the ages are distributed evenly.\n\n\\section{Earning a Terminal Degree}\n\nAnother data that was available in the bulletin was the years that other degrees were received. Although\nfor this analysis only the BA was considered, the year that a professor received the last degrees may also\nbe significant. If professors in certain departments took longer to obtain their last degree, this may\nexplain how the department is older than others. On the other hand, if professors were only required a\nBA, this may explain how the department is younger.\\\\\n\nHere is a scatter plot showing the relationship between each professor's estimated age, and the year he/she\nreceived the last degree. The black diagonal line indicates professors whose last degree was the BA.\\\\\n\n<<fig.pos=\"h\", fig.height=4, fig.cap=\"Age with the year the last degree was received\", echo = FALSE>>=\nget_plot3()\n@\n\nDivision II professors seem to require longer to receive their last degrees, while PE professors require\nless than others. It is also interesting to note the professors who take a significant amount of time\nafter receiving the BA to receive their last degrees. This is presumably because they spent some time out\nof academia before entering graduate school. Most of these professors are from Division I and Division II,\nwhich may indicate the importance of a terminal degree in Division III even outside of academia.\\\\\n\nThe professors who only received a BA can also be examined. Most of these professors are PE professors or\nare in Division I, although there are some from Division II and Division III. This also demonstrates how\nterminal degrees may not be considered as important when becoming a professor in Division I. This contradicts\nthe hypothesis that professors are younger because they were not required terminal degrees, since Division II\nand Division III professors were on average younger than Division I professors. Thus the age distribution\nmay not depend greatly on whether the professors obtained a terminal degree or not.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nThis paper investigated the average age of the Williams College faculty, and how it was affected by\nfactors such as departments and terminal degrees. The data showed that PE professors are the youngest,\nwhile Division II and Division III seem to be younger on average than Division I also. This result was also\ncompared with whether each professor were required a terminal degree, but it was concluded that this did not\nhave a significant influence on the age distribution in each division.\n\n\\end{document}\n",
